# Notary v2 Alpha 3 Release

## Overview
Notary v2 working group is pleased to announce the third release, Alpha 3. This release includes updates to the [notaryproject/notaryproject](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject) repo to provide the community with updated specifications and an updated implementation of Notation client for signing and verifying artifacts.

- [Notary v2 specifications](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject) ***[(notaryproject-v1.0.0-draft.3)](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/releases/tag/v1.0.0-draft2)***    (Updated in this release)  
- [Notation Library](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go) (https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-core-go) ***[(notation-go-v1.0.0-alpha.3)](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go-lib/releases/tag/v0.7.0-alpha.1)***   (Updated in this release)
- [Notation CLI](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation)   ***([notation-v1.0.0-alpha.3)](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/releases/tag/v0.79.0-alpha.1)***   (Updated in this release) 

## Goal of the release
- Update Notary v2 specifications 
    - Implementors can use the updated specfications to develop their own implementation of Notary v2 in language/platforms of their choice, and/or contribute to Notation client development .
    - Users can use the included Notation client for the following workflows
 - Update "Notation" (CLI client) implementation to match the latest specifications. With the new client, users can
    - Sign and Verify images with remote key stores
    - Sign and Verify images with test keys/certificates for demonstration and getting started use only. 
    - Setup Trust stores with the new directory based structure
    - Configure Trust Policy as a JSON document
    - Store signatures in registries compliant to the ORAS Reference spec [RC-1](https://github.com/oras-project/oras-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.1)

*This release is not recommended for use in production environments. It is suggested for testing use only to provide feedback to the Notary v2 working group*

## List of feature/capabilities added with this release
For detailed notes on each of the individual repositories (NotaryProject, Notation (for reference CLI implementation) and Notation libraries) users can refer to the individual release notes. A summary view is provided in this document.

### Notary v2 specifications
Updated Trust Policy, Trust Store,  Signature Verification and Signing workflows along with extensibility mechanisms via Notation plugins.
- A final JWS based [signature envelope format.](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/blob/main/signature-envelope-jws.md)
- Updated [Signature specfication](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/blob/main/signature-envelope-jws.md) with extensibilty provisions for additional signature envelope format.
- Updated [signing and verification workflows](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/blob/main/signing-and-verification-workflow.md)
- Introducing a new [Signing scheme](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/blob/main/signing-scheme.md) to intgerate Notation Client with Signing Services
- Updated  [trust store and trust policy](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/blob/main/trust-store-trust-policy-specification.md) specfication

### Notation CLI Client
Notation is a standalone CLI client based on Notary v2 specs. It supports signing, verifying and storing artifacts in [oras-artifacts-spec](https://github.com/oras-project/artifacts-spec/) compliant registries. Starting with this release of Notation, the trust store will be based on a directory strucutre wand trust store as a JSON document. Users can simply insert  the public certificats inside pre-configured directories for configuring their trust store, and modify the trust policy document to granularly control the scope and behaviour of the signature verification policies. The use of the existing CLI commands (introduced in the first version of Notation client when the keys/certificates for signing and verifying were specified in a file) is not recommedned.  Refer https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/specs/notation-config.md.  e. 

To start using Notation Refer: https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/hello-signing.md

### Notation Library 
Written in the GO language the Library is broken up into two seperate repos - [Notation-go](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go) and [Notation-core-go](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-core-go)

## List of fixed issues
Refer individual release notes.

## Roadmap Guidance
*This is not an exhaustive list. Users should refer to the Notary v2 roadmap at https://github.com/notaryproject/roadmap#readme for seeing the plan for subsequent releases and refer to individual subprojects (repositories) releases notes for details*

1. The current signature format is the proposed format for RC-1 release. Notary v2 community plans to support additional signature formats ( such as COSE)
2. Revocation support is planned for an upcoming release
3. Alternate signature storage schemes which can use OCI Distribution 1.0 based registries is under investigation for a future release

### Backwards Compatibility
This version of Notation client is not compatiable with any of the prior releases.
