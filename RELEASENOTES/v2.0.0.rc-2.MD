## Goal of the release
- Notary v2 specifications
  - Support signing and verification using the fallback method to improve backward compatibility with OCI v1.0 compliant registry and comply with OCI distribution spec and image-spec v1.1. With this method, Notary v2 now supports a reference types solution that allows you to enable supply chain artifact reference. 
- Update "Notation" (CLI client) implementation to match the latest specifications. With this new version of Notation client, users can
  - Able to choose a specific OCI manifest type (OCI image manifest or OCI artifact manifest) to store the signature, alongside with OCI artifact in a registry.
  - Able to add key-value pairs to the signature payload when signing an OCI artifact.
  - Use a new "inspect" command to see relevant details encoded in all signtures associated with an image.
- Updated Notation libraries
  - Improved error messaging, documentation, dependencies and bug fixes

    
*This is the second supported release from the Notary v2 community. Refer prior (RC-1) release description [here](https://github.com/notaryproject/roadmap/blob/main/RELEASENOTES/v2.0.0.rc-1.MD) and release definitions [here](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/RELEASE_MANAGEMENT.md)*

For detailed notes on each of the individual repositories (NotaryProject, Notation (for reference CLI implementation) and Notation libraries) users can refer to the individual release notes. A summary view is provided in this document.

### Notation CLI Client
Notation is a standalone CLI client based on Notary v2 specs. It supports signing, verifying, and storing signatures in registries supporting signatures as references to images.

In this release of Notation command, the following CLI commands are supported. 
  - **sign**        Sign OCI artifacts
  - **verify**      Verify OCI artifacts
  - **certificate** Manage certificates in trust store for verifying 
  - **key**         Manage keys used for signing
  - **list**        List signatures of the signed artifact
  - **login**       Login to registry
  - **logout**      Log out from the logged in registries
  - **plugin**      Manage plugins  
  - **version**     Show the notation version information

As part of this release, users have to create a trust policy configuration file before verifying arifacts. 

To start using Notation, please refer to the [Notation quick start](https://notaryproject.dev/docs/quickstart/). 

### Notation Library 
Written in the Golang language the library is divided up into two separate repositories,[Notation-go](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go) and [Notation-core-go](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-core-go). Notation-go was updated with the following enhancements:
- Added optional metadata at time of signing images
- Added check for plugin versioning and compatability

## Roadmap Guidance
*The major enhancements planned for Notation v1.0.0-RC.3 include but are not limited to the following list. Users should refer to the Notary v2 roadmap at https://github.com/notaryproject/roadmap#readme for seeing the plan for subsequent releases and refer to individual subprojects (repositories) releases notes for details.*

1. Revocation support via Notation client will come in a future release. Spec update for revocation support is planned for the next release candidate
2. CLI for managing trust policy is planned for the next release candidate
3. Sign/verify offline artifacts
4. UX improvement for notation plugin
5. Simplify and improve Notation CLI installation by adding the installer for each popular platform/OS (See Simplify installation experience for Notation CLI #76)

### Backwards Compatibility
- This version of Notation client is compatible with RC-1, the prior releases of Notation client.
- This version of Notation client is meant for registries compliant with both the OCI [image-spec v1.0.2](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/releases/tag/v1.0.2) and [image spec v1.1.0.rc.2](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/releases/tag/v1.1.0-rc2). The version is also compliant with the OCI [distribution spec v1.1.0-rc.1](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/releases/tag/v1.1.0-rc1)
