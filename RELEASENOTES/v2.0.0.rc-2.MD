## Goal of the release
- Notary v2 specifications
  - Updates to support signing and verification using the fallback method for referrers, as specified in the 1.1 version release candidate of the OCI Distribution specification. With this method, Notary v2 now supports a reference types solution but within the bounds of OCI 1.0 Image and Distribution specs 
- Update "Notation" (CLI client) implementation to match the latest specifications. With this new version of Notation client, users can
  - Choose the method to manage signatures inside their registries - image manifest or artifact manifest.
  - Provide optional meta-data at time of signing as key-value pairs.
  - Use a new "inspect" command to see relevant details encoded in all signtures associated with an image.
- Updated Notation libraries
  - Improved error messaging, documentation, dependencies and bug fixes

    
*This is the second supported release from the Notary v2 community. Refer prior (RC-1) release description [here](https://github.com/notaryproject/roadmap/blob/main/RELEASENOTES/v2.0.0.rc-1.MD) and release definitions [here](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/RELEASE_MANAGEMENT.md)*

### Notation Library

## Roadmap Guidance
*This is not an exhaustive list. Users should refer to the Notary v2 roadmap at https://github.com/notaryproject/roadmap#readme for seeing the plan for subsequent releases and refer to individual subprojects (repositories) releases notes for details*

1. Revocation support via Notation client will come in a future release. Spec update for revocation support is planned for the next release candidate
2. CLI for managing trust policy is planned for the next release candidate
3. Sign/verify offline artifacts
4. UX improvement for notation plugin

### Backwards Compatibility
- This version of Notation client is compatible with RC-1, the prior releases of Notation client.
- This version of Notation client is meant for registries compliant to both the OCI [1.0.2 image spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/releases/tag/v1.0.2) or [1.1.0-rc2 image spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/releases/tag/v1.1.0-rc2). The version is also compliant to the OCI [1.1.0-rc1 distribution spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/releases/tag/v1.1.0-rc1)
