Notary v2 working group is pleased to announce its first release candidate, RC-1. Refer release definitions [here](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/RELEASE_MANAGEMENT.md). This release includes updates to the [notaryproject/notaryproject](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject) repo to provide the community with updated specifications and an updated implementation of Notation client for signing and verifying artifacts.

## Goal of the release
- Candidate Release Spec
    - A cross industry and cross registry support signing and verification of any OCI image or registry artifact
    - Support for two signature envelope formats - JWS and COSE. Customers can choose the format with their choice of plugins
    - Update on use of plugins for signing and verification. Plugins let vendors and users integrate base Notation client with their choice of Key Vaults and PKI
    - Users to build/integerate their own implementation of Notary v2 specfications into their CI/CD
 - Update "Notation" (CLI client) implementation to match the latest specifications. With this new version of Notation client, users can
    - Sign images with remote key stores that securely store the signing keys
    - Verify signatures using Trust stores and Trust policy configuration of Notation client
    - Sign images and Verify signatures with locally stored test keys/certificates for demonstration use only
    - Setup Trust stores with the new directory-based structure using the notation client "certificate" commands to add/delete/list/show
    - Configure Trust Policy as a JSON document, with support for registry scope and signature verfication levels to customize the behaviour during verification.
    - Manage signatures in registries compliant to the OCI [1.1.0-rc2 image spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/releases/tag/v1.1.0-rc2) and OCI [1.1.0-rc1 distribution spec] ([https://github.com/oras-project/oras-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.2](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/releases/tag/v1.1.0-rc1)
  - Updated libraries for Notation
    - Both Notation-go and Notaiton-core-go libraries have been updated.
    - Users can directly integerate with notation-go for signing and verification APIs. These APIs are made configurable to support verification of pre-fetched signatures one at a time.  
*This is the first supported release from the Notary v2 community. Refer release definitions [here](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/RELEASE_MANAGEMENT.md). We suggest using it for testing and providing feedback to the Notary v2 working group only*

## List of feature/capabilities added with this release
For detailed notes on each of the individual repositories (NotaryProject, Notation (for reference CLI implementation) and Notation libraries) users can refer to the individual release notes. A summary view is provided in this document.

### Notation CLI Client
Notation is a standalone CLI client based on Notary v2 specs. It supports signing, verifying, and storing signatures in registries supporitng signatures as references to images.

In this release of Notation command, the following CLI commands are supported. 
  - sign        Sign artifacts
  - verify      Verify OCI artifacts
  - certificate Manage certificates in trust store for verifying 
  - key         Manage keys used for signing
  - list        List signatures of the signed artifact
  - login       Login to registry
  - logout      Log out from the logged in registries
  - plugin      Manage plugins  ( Only notation plugin list commmand is support in this release)
  - version     Show the notation version information
  - help        Help about any command

As part of this release, users have to create a trust policy configuration file before verifying arifacts. 

To start using Notation Refer: https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/hello-signing.md

### Notation Library 
Written in the GO language the Library is divided up into two separate repos - [Notation-go](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go) and [Notation-core-go](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-core-go)

## List of fixed issues
Refer individual release notes.

## Roadmap Guidance
*This is not an exhaustive list. Users should refer to the Notary v2 roadmap at https://github.com/notaryproject/roadmap#readme for seeing the plan for subsequent releases and refer to individual subprojects (repositories) releases notes for details*

1. Alternate signature storage schemes which can use OCI Distribution 1.0 based registries ("fallback support") is planned for the next release candidate
2. Revocation support via Notation client will come in a future release. Spec update for revocation is planned for the next release candidate


### Backwards Compatibility
This version of Notation client is not compatible with any of the prior releases.
