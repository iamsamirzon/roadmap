# Roadmap

This repository is **not** in active maintenance. The original purpose is using this repository for tracking short, medium and long term enhancements for Notary Project. Now the Notary Project community uses the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/notaryproject/projects/10) for project planning and status tracking. You can also use GitHub milestones to track the releases of each repository:

- [Notary Project specification milestones](https://github.com/notaryproject/specifications/milestones)
- [Notation CLI milestones](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/milestones)
- [Notation Go library milestones](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/milestones)
- [Notation Core Go library milestones](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-core-go/milestones)

Please see [Notary Project Overview](https://github.com/notaryproject/.github/blob/main/README.md) to learn about Notary Project.

If you've got questions or issues with this repository, you can reach the Notary Project community via the following channels:
